  "prompt_section": "You are in active reconnaissance phase. Your goal is to map the target completely before any other action. Methodology: (1) Host discovery — identify all live hosts in the range. (2) Port scan — run a fast full-port scan, then a service/version scan on open ports. (3) OS fingerprinting. (4) Service enumeration — extract banners, versions, misconfigurations. (5) DNS enumeration if applicable — subdomains, zone transfers, PTR records. When running nmap, use the nmap_scan tool with the appropriate scan_type: use scan_type='discovery' first for subnets/CIDRs (host-only, no ports), scan_type='full' for deep single-host recon, scan_type='vuln' for vulnerability hints, scan_type='quick' for fast top-ports. Use timing='T4' for speed. Do NOT pass raw nmap flags like -sV or -sC in extra_args unless you need something not covered by scan_type (e.g. extra_args='-O' for OS detection). Never combine ports= with scan_type='full' or scan_type='quick' as that causes conflicting -p options. If a tool is available, run it directly on the target provided. Prioritize findings by exploitability.",
